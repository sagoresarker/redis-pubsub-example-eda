## More details explanation of the system (FYI)
**Data and Event Flow:**

1. The publishers in the Go application publish messages to specific channels in Redis. These messages can be triggered by various events, such as creating or updating users or orders.

2. Redis, acting as the message broker, receives the messages from the publishers and distributes them to the appropriate channels. Any subscribers listening to those channels will receive the published messages.

3. The REST API handlers receive incoming requests, such as creating or updating users or orders. Upon successful processing, the handlers invoke the publishers to publish messages to the corresponding Redis channels (e.g., `user.created`, `user.updated`, `order.created`, `order.updated`).

4. The subscribers in the Go application are continuously listening to the Redis channels they are subscribed to. When a message is published to a subscribed channel, the subscriber receives the message, deserializes it, and performs any necessary processing or logging based on the message type (user or order events).

5. The subscribers can log the received messages, trigger additional actions, or perform any other required processing based on the application's business logic.

**Components:**

- **Go App**: The main Go application that hosts the publishers, subscribers, and other application logic.
- **Publishers**: Components within the Go application responsible for publishing messages to Redis channels.
- **Redis**: The Redis server, acting as the central message broker, distributing messages from publishers to subscribers.
- **Subscribers**: Components within the Go application that listen to specific Redis channels and handle received messages.
- **REST APIs**: The HTTP APIs exposed by the Go application, allowing clients to interact with the application and trigger events (e.g., creating or updating users or orders).
- **Handlers**: Components within the Go application that handle incoming HTTP requests, process the requests, and invoke the publishers to publish messages to Redis channels.

## How it works *Exactly
Now, let me describe how user and order operations are handled by the pub/sub system.

**User Operations:**

1. **Creating a User**:
   - When a client sends a request to create a new user (e.g., `POST /users`), the request is handled by the `CreateUser` function in the `UserHandler`.
   - After successful validation and processing of the user data, the `UserHandler` invokes the `PublishMessages` method of the `MessagePublisher`.
   - The `MessagePublisher` serializes the user data and publishes a message to the `user.created` channel in Redis.
   - The message is received by the `MessageConsumer` (subscriber) in the Go application, which is listening to the `user.created` channel.
   - The `MessageConsumer` deserializes the message and processes the user creation event.
   - In the current implementation, the `MessageConsumer` logs the user creation event using the `SubscriberLogger`.
   - Additional logic can be added to the `MessageConsumer` to perform other actions upon user creation, such as sending a welcome email, updating a database, or triggering other events.

2. **Updating a User**:
   - When a client sends a request to update an existing user (e.g., `PUT /users/:id`), the request is handled by the `UpdateUser` function in the `UserHandler`.
   - After successful validation and processing of the updated user data, the `UserHandler` invokes the `PublishMessages` method of the `MessagePublisher`.
   - The `MessagePublisher` serializes the user data (including the user ID) and publishes a message to the `user.updated` channel in Redis.
   - The message is received by the `MessageConsumer` (subscriber) in the Go application, which is listening to the `user.updated` channel.
   - The `MessageConsumer` deserializes the message and processes the user update event.
   - In the current implementation, the `MessageConsumer` logs the user update event using the `SubscriberLogger`, including the user ID and the updated user data.
   - Additional logic can be added to the `MessageConsumer` to perform other actions upon user updates, such as updating a database, sending a notification email, or triggering other events.

**Order Operations:**

1. **Creating an Order**:
   - When a client sends a request to create a new order (e.g., `POST /orders`), the request is handled by the `CreateOrder` function in the `OrderHandler`.
   - After successful validation and processing of the order data, the `OrderHandler` invokes the `PublishMessages` method of the `MessagePublisher`.
   - The `MessagePublisher` serializes the order data and publishes a message to the `order.created` channel in Redis.
   - The message is received by the `MessageConsumer` (subscriber) in the Go application, which is listening to the `order.created` channel.
   - The `MessageConsumer` deserializes the message and processes the order creation event.
   - In the current implementation, the `MessageConsumer` logs the order creation event using the `SubscriberLogger`.
   - Additional logic can be added to the `MessageConsumer` to perform other actions upon order creation, such as updating inventory, sending a confirmation email, or triggering other events.

2. **Updating an Order Status**:
   - When a client sends a request to update the status of an existing order (e.g., `PUT /orders/:id/status`), the request is handled by the `UpdateOrderStatus` function in the `OrderHandler`.
   - After successful validation and processing of the updated order status, the `OrderHandler` invokes the `PublishMessages` method of the `MessagePublisher`.
   - The `MessagePublisher` serializes the order data (including the order ID and the new status) and publishes a message to the `order.updated` channel in Redis.
   - The message is received by the `MessageConsumer` (subscriber) in the Go application, which is listening to the `order.updated` channel.
   - The `MessageConsumer` deserializes the message and processes the order status update event.
   - In the current implementation, the `MessageConsumer` logs the order status update event using the `SubscriberLogger`, including the order ID and the new status.
   - Additional logic can be added to the `MessageConsumer` to perform other actions upon order status updates, such as updating a database, sending a notification email, or triggering other events related to shipping or order fulfillment.

The pub/sub system acts as a communication layer between the different components of the application. When user or order operations occur, messages are published to the appropriate Redis channels, and the subscribers handle these messages asynchronously.
